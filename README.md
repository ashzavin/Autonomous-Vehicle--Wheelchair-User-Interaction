# Autonomous-Vehicle--Wheelchair-User-Interaction
We implemented in total of eight scenes (two base scenes) in the Unity 3D game engine for this project. C# programming language has been used to control different objects of the unity scenes. This repository only contains the C# code files and Unity scene information for the project. Necessary assets and the full project will be shared upon request.

A preliminary research work of this project can be found here:
